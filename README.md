# Agentic-Data-Engineering-with-Snowflake-and-Ascend.io
This project demonstrates a modern, declarative approach to data engineering by building an end-to-end data pipeline within the Ascend.io platform, fully integrated with a Snowflake data cloud. The system leverages AI agents to automate the orchestration, scaling, and monitoring of data flows.
